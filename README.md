Hello, I am a game dev (kind of) that is working to create a few nice indie games for people to enjoy.

I am proficient in coding: Python(3), and c#.

I am working on expanding my knowledge in c, c++.

Other things worth mentioning: Knowledge in using Blender, 3D Printing software, and Video editing software (Davici Resolve).

I am currently working on and will provide some code for my game --title to be decided--
